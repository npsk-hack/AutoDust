# AutoDust

A portable waste segregation system, targeting the ever-growing issue of waste segregation and management in today's world.

The system is written purely in the programming language, Python, and uses Object Detection algorithms to detect and indentify the waste placed before it, further clasifying it into Biodegradable and Non-biodegradable waste types. Upon classification, AutoDust actively sweeps the waste into the right container (inspired from windsheild wipers).

AutoDust is unique in it's innovation and application. A truly one-of-a-kind product.
